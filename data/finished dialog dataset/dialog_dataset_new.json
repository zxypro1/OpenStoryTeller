[{"input":"In the DND game, the players discuss the potential knowledge of the chain devil about the Bastion of Flesh. The DM describes the players' recent actions, including the transformation of their new dwarven friend into a werebear and the discovery of Utugash, a pit fiend sitting on a throne between two pools of glowing blood. Utugash speaks telepathically to the players and asks what they bring to him to pleasure, prompting them to roll initiative. The players joke about their high initiative rolls.\n\n20 to 15. Who has what?\nSAM: 19.\nTALIESIN: 15.\nNOELLE: 16.\nTRAVIS: Samesies.\nNOELLE: Oh, we're going together. Yeah!\nMARISHA: 17.\nSAM: Wow, we all did pretty well.\nMARISHA: Yeah we did, for us.\nLAURA: What'd you roll?\nSAM: We're all between 15 and 24.\n","output":"All right, so, as the pit fiend's still just standing there, its arm hanging over the edge of this giant axe it's using, propping it, it stares at Grog. It seems to be completely lazy, confident, and doesn't feel threatened whatsoever by the presence of this goliath that has stepped into its visual range. However, top of the round, Vax and Vex. What do you guys want to do?","instruction":"How can we project the trajectory of these events?"},{"input":"In the DND game, the players discuss whether Trinket will still come into Raven's Slumber if he falls and Vex doesn't see him. They joke about testing it out. Vax attacks Utugash with his blades, hitting all three times but failing to poison him. Vex moves closer to Doty and holds her attack until she has visual. She then has Trinket attack Utugash as her bonus action, which the DM allows.\n\nAll right, let me check one thing real fast on beastmaster. You are technically taking the attack action yourself. I'll allow it.\nLAURA: You said I can get my attacks and then have Trinket be my bonus action, because he can do one attack as my bonus action. Single attack on bonus for bestial fury.\n","output":"That's true. Yeah. I'll allow it. How it usually works is your action is the attack, and then as a bonus action you can give it, it's like you're both attacking at the same time. You're holding your action, but it is still an attack action, so I'll allow it. Go ahead and use it. It's fine.","instruction":"What trajectory do you envision following this incident?"},{"input":"In the DND game, Vax attacks Utugash with his blades, hitting all three times but failing to poison him.

It doesn't do as much damage as you hoped it would.\nLAURA: Does it do any damage?\n","output":"It does some damage, but not as much as you'd hoped. All righty. That ends your turn.

Taryon opens a window in the wall, and the players joke about its design.\n\nYeah, no. It's beautifully carved. Yeah, it was like some Italian architects designed this beautiful--\nSAM: It's a casement window, so I have to go-- (squeaking) (laughter)\n","output":"Perfect. So, to Taryon.

As soon as that happens--","instruction":"Prolong the tale."},{"input":"In the DND game, Taryon opens a window in the wall, which prompts Vex to make her attack against Utugash. She uses Bramble Shot for her first attack, hitting with a 30 and dealing 17 damage plus lightning damage and Sneak Attack. Utugash passes the strength saving throw. Her second attack hits with a 21 and deals 15 damage plus lightning damage. The players joke about Noelle's bear character being bad at math.\n\n21 hits.\nLAURA: All right! What's five plus eight? Is that 13?\nNOELLE: Yes.\nLAURA: 13.\nNOELLE: Why are you asking me? I'm a bear. Notoriously bad at math.\nLIAM: Moneybags, what the hell?\nLAURA: 15 with two lightning damage. 16, 17.\n","output":"All righty. So both arrows fire off. You watch as the one slams into the side of Utugash and the vines wrap around. Utugash brings one arm up, tears them off of his body, picks up the axe and hefts it over the shoulder looking back at where the window now exists where once there was none.

Taryon and Grog see it. Keyleth moves towards the window, and after apologizing to Vex and Taryon, casts Blight on Utugash through the window. The players joke about Melissa Etheridge's \"Come to my window\" song.\n\nSo you'd have go through the window to do it.\nSAM: (sings) Come to my window!\nMATT, LAURA: (sing) Come inside.\nMARISHA: Yeah, sure, I'll go through the window.\n","output":"Okay, so you step through, you get about there. You have ten feet more movement. So that'll do it. All right, so.","instruction":"Continue the narrative journey."},{"input":"In the DND game, Utugash takes half damage from Keyleth's Blight spell due to his magic resistance.

Tova, in bear form, runs towards the front door and considers carrying Keyleth through the window but decides to barrel through and push her out.

I'm going to go for it.\n","output":"You rush over and go right past, now bear and bear, side by side. Keyleth, you get knocked out of the window, prone.

You back up with another strike.","instruction":"What lies beyond the current horizon of events?"},{"input":"In the DND game, Tova's first attack misses Utugash, but the second one hits for 14 damage. She uses her bonus action to cast Curse of Mutual Suffering and amplifies it, taking 14 points of damage and rolling a d8 for Crimson Rite damage, which ends up being only one point. The players joke about Tova's special abilities.\n\nAll righty. So go ahead and roll your Crimson Rite die, which I think is a d8. So you just roll a d8 and you take that much damage.\nNOELLE: Oh. Right. I thought that it was my other one, so that's fine. That's great. I took one point of damage.\n","output":"There you go. So you take one point of damage, and, as far as the Mutual Suffering-- All right, there you go. So. You watch as you rush up to it, you slash it twice with your claws, and as you pick up your sword, you put one hand up, and as you close your fist, you watch as blood pools in the center of your palm and drips out the corners of your fingers. As it does, you watch the veins on the outside of Utugash's stomach pulse for a second, and his chuckle goes (groans), like he got a tummy ache. All right, that ends your turn.","instruction":"Drive the narrative forward."},{"input":"In the DND game, Tova uses her blood curse to cast Curse of Mutual Suffering on Utugash, causing him to feel pain when she takes damage. Grog runs up to Utugash's opposite side and smashes his Titanstone Knuckles together, transforming into his larger self. He makes two reckless attacks, hitting with both and dealing 18 and 22 damage respectively. The players joke about the Autobots and sing \"You got the touch, you got the power.\"\n\nBoth hit. Go ahead and roll damage for each.\nTRAVIS: 18 for the first one. These are two-handed, by the way. 22 for the second one.\n","output":"Nice! So 40 points of damage on the two strikes. As you rush up, almost diving into the pool, you skirt off to the side, slam the Titanstone Gauntlets together and grow to your larger size. Swirling the axe in the air, you go (whoosh), and the second strike in a big X formation across the side of it. You see it gashing across the arm and the upper muscles of the shoulder, and you see his fingers grip the axe with more anger and frustration.","instruction":"How can we project the trajectory of these events?"},{"input":"In the DND game, Percy blasts off the lock and opens the door. He then takes two shots at Utugash, one with the Animus for a trick shot on his arm, dealing 14 points of damage plus 23 points of lightning damage from Cabal's Ruin, but Utugash makes the strength check to keep his axe. Percy takes one more shot at Utugash, dealing 16 points of damage. He then moves behind the door for cover. The players joke about calling out the wrong name and PTSD flashbacks.\n\nOkay, because you blew the lock off and the door's somewhat ajar, we'll say you move it open and get partially inside, that's as far as you can get.\nTALIESIN: I just want to use it for cover.\n","output":"All right, so you get behind the door, and you're ducking in the side there. Perfect. Okay. At the end of your turn, Utugash is going to use a legendary action to attack you.","instruction":"Expand the storyline."},{"input":"In the DND game, Percy takes two shots at Utugash, one with the Animus for a trick shot on his arm, dealing 14 points of damage plus 23 points of lightning damage from Cabal's Ruin, but Utugash makes the strength check to keep his axe. Percy takes one more shot at Utugash, dealing 16 points of damage. He then moves behind the door for cover. Utugash uses a legendary action to attack Tova, hitting with a 16 because she has no armor on. The players joke about Tova's wrestling name being Ursa Major.\n\nThat is going to be a 16 to hit. I think that hits you because you have no armor on.\nNOELLE: It hits. Yeah, I don't have no armor on.\n","output":"So, as the giant axe swings towards you, that's going to be 23 points of slashing damage with the axe. However, that does trigger the Mutual Suffering, so he takes 23 points of necrotic damage from the impact. As the axe swings and cuts across your bear chest, all of sudden, where the blood bulged earlier, you watch a secondary wound open simultaneously where no weapon was apparently visible and blood begins to just trickle out. Devil blood.","instruction":"Progress with the story development."},{"input":"In the DND game, Percy moves behind the door for cover while Utugash attacks Tova with a legendary action, dealing 23 points of slashing damage and triggering Mutual Suffering, causing Utugash to take 23 points of necrotic damage.

At the top of the round, Keyleth is face-first on the ground and Tova and Grog make perception checks, with Trinket also rolling a 26 due to his keen sense of smell.\n\nWhatever his perception bonus is.\nLAURA: Oh, wow! 17 plus nine. 26!\n","output":"Trinket doesn't know why, but he's like (sniffs).

Small!\nTRAVIS: Why do you sound like a bear?\n","output":"You hear the sound of grinding stone. You don't see anything. Unfortunately, the low light in here, and your not great perception, you don't pick out any visual, other than-- a familiar sound to you, Grog-- as something in the ceiling opens up, and suddenly searing hot oil comes spilling from the ceiling, down onto both you, Trinket, and Tova. I need you to make dexterity saves, Tova, Trinket, and Grog.","instruction":"Keep up the storytelling."},{"input":"In the DND game, Trinket picks up other scents in the room and Tova talks to Trinket to learn that there are two small things in the room. Suddenly, searing hot oil spills from the ceiling, causing Tova, Trinket, and Grog to take 21 points of fire damage. Grog is resistant to fire damage, but the oil is boiling, so he questions if his resistance applies. The players also discuss the devil's immunity to fire damage.\n\nThey're devils, man.\nTRAVIS: So I'm resistant to fire, but this is boiling oil, does that count?\n","output":"It's considered fire damage because it's the heat that does it, so you take half of that. Put you at ten. So as that's happening, as the oil splashes down, you guys are tensing from the impact. Vax, you peer around the corner and you hear (creaking), and you look to the other side just as the portcullis has been lifted, and you see coming out of the opposite side the chamber is one of the bone devils that you've seen wandering in the street and is pouring from the other side. Its claws come through. It's as wide as the hallway, its jaw unhinges, its tongue slathering, these small flapping insect-like wings across the back of its scapula, its claws reach out towards you.","instruction":"Develop the narrative more."},{"input":"In the DND game, searing hot oil spills from the ceiling, causing Tova, Trinket, and Grog to take 21 points of fire damage. Grog is resistant to fire damage, but the oil is considered fire damage, so he takes half of it.

The players also discuss if the pit fiend took damage from Tova's Mutual Suffering curse.\n\nAnd with the tail, that is a 24.\nLIAM: That also hits. I will use Uncanny Dodge for the tail.\n","output":"Okay. So the first claw hits you, you take 11 points of slashing damage, and as the first claw strikes you across the chest, the second one, you manage to duck right out of the way, it slams into the stonework, and as you glance up, you try and dodge and roll out of the way as the tail scrapes you across the back.

As you throw the dagger, as the creature watches you dart past, it streaks out to try and strike at you, but you're already gone. As you turn around, you throw the dagger. It strikes right into the chest of the bone devil, as it bursts with this dark grayish-white light indicative of the Raven Queen's direct impact.

You watch as nearby Whisperers begin to stop and perch on the edge of buildings to watch. You get the sense that what you guys have done has drawn some attention. As you reach the end of this 15-minute period, you're pulled down a large road and the buildings begin to grow a little thin in this area. You're brought to what looks to be a very, very heavy set of doors, this crimson gate that is humongous: 20 feet by ten feet for each side of the gate, so 40 feet across. It leans at an angle, like a gargantuan cellar door that sits on its own in the center. As you begin to approach, you hear chains suddenly (metal scraping). The doors slowly open with a creaking noise as you're brought towards it. They open, and you can see inside it is lightless, it is dark. The two bone devils tugging further, and with each tug, the chains that connect you all choke and pull you forward. You nearly stumble again as you're brought over the stairway lip and down into this darkened chamber below. You are brought down a seemingly endless set of stairs, the darkness only occasionally broken by the passing faintly red-glowing sconce that passes by as you're brought down. You hear the various mutterings of various Infernal phrases being spoken, chuckled between the devils that speak in your vicinity. You then come to a leveling point. The stairs come to an end, the light opening up in this area; still dim, the reddish glow that occasionally gives you a glimpse of the interior. This, you can only imagine, would be what a prison in hell looks like. The metal and stone walls are warped and misshapen in places; they're almost buckling under the weight of the plane they're holding. You can see what looks to be stone arms that are either carved out of the walls or have been jammed into it as part of the decor. And you see giant metal hooks that occasionally eject out the side, some of them with the remains of some sort of prisoner or meat that has been left to slowly rot. More of those small devilish insects you encountered when you first arrived are gathering and feasting on these remnants. You begin to hear various echoes of screams from some distant place within this labyrinthine series of hallways that have bounced through enough walls to the point that it's this constant ringing gasp, occasionally mixed with this high-pitched whine. This wailing, and this sound of horrible torture. It's very familiar to you, Tova. You have no idea how long you were here before, but it seems endless in hindsight. It could have been days, weeks, months; you don't recall. The air itself is extremely hot, stagnant, and humid with sweat and has that subterranean putrescense to it. The idea that mold and suffering pervade the atmosphere. And, as you're carted through these hallways, you're turned right, left, forward past multiple intersections. More devils pass by. You see another erinyes step by with three other minions to her sides. She hisses as you walk past. You are brought past so many different pathways that it begins to all blend. You're trying to pay attention to remember which way you came, but sometimes the turns almost go so fast, it causes you to lose track of where you originally started. You get the essence that not only this is a massive prison, but it's designed to keep anyone from finding their way back out. You turn one corner as you hear a series of very high-intensity screams that cut through the relative din in the background, and as you turn you see three people: two humans and one male half-elf that are naked and strung up by chains in front of what looks like a large forge. You see there a 12-foot-tall horned devil, his wings folded up over his shoulders, these giant crested horns off the front of his skull. Very Tim Curry Legends-style, who's currently heating this long brand in the forge as he's glaring at them. And as you all walk past, his eyes catch yours and he gives you a nod as he sears it in the body of the half-elf, who begins to quiver and scream against the chains. But he just gives you the rest of the head nod as you pass, cross the door, not seeing them any further.","instruction":"Keep the story in motion."},{"input":"In the DND game, the group is pulled through the ceiling and brought to the streets of the Iron City of Dis, where they are hit and pulled along by devils.

They realize that Frumpkin is too far away to be pulled back using their current abilities and Caleb tells Frumpkin to swim back.\n\nTo pull him back yeah.\nLIAM: Then I would tell him then to swim back. If we, in our game, are allowing connection as long as it's not broken, I would just tell him to come back.\n","output":"Okay, cool. So you are fine.

It's a larger storage building, it's not remarkable in its design or decor.","instruction":"Go on with the storyline."},{"input":"In the DND game, the group discusses whether or not Nott will eat Laura's weasel, with Nott promising not to. They all dive down with Beau holding onto a lead line, and eventually come to the base of the tube where the grate is located. They brace themselves against the tunnel and attempt to break through the grate, rolling independently for strength checks. Yasha rolls a 20 and succeeds in breaking through the grate.\n\nThat's the DC you needed.\nTRAVIS: Oh shit, really?\n","output":"Yeah, so you both are holding on and pulling. You get your foot in some of the imperfect stonework where elements of the masonry pokes out which gives you a foot groove and one part where some of the stone had been rotted away and that's just enough of a point to lock yourself in. As you pull, you feel (shifting) and eventually it comes out of its mooring on the wall and then slides off to the side.

They realize that their constitution modifier determines how many minutes they can hold their breath underwater. They decide to try breaking through the second grate and make a plan to pull it on the count of three. Travis stays at the mouth of the tunnel while the others swim down and come back up again. They tie the rope to the mouth of the grate and jump back in for a second attempt.\n\nAll right, you do that. You guys all jump back in a second time?\nLAURA: Yeah.\n","output":"You dive back down below, pushing through the darker depths of the bay, eventually finding yourselves back to the tunnel where the grate has been shifted to the side. So now you have, at an angle underneath, you can swim over or under it. You guys pincer off of it, taking two different directions, and meeting on the opposite side. You go a few more lengths before the tunnel shifts upward. You both have darkvision, if I recall? Good, because there was no light source in the water, beyond just the distant glow and shifting of the sunlight through the water. You make your way back up, and you find the grate above you. This area, the footholds aren't as easy because it's not quite as close to the elements, so the DC's a little higher, but if you guys grab hold, you can go ahead and make a check.","instruction":"What outcomes might we see as a result of these circumstances?"},{"input":"In the DND game, Beau swims through the tunnel carrying the weasel and the puppy. The group worries about the safety of the animals and debates whether or not to get rid of them. Beau makes an athletics check to push through the water while carrying both animals.

You bring your goggles down so you can actually see where you're going once the light begins to subside. You still hear in the water above you (squeal).\nMARISHA: I totally forgot about the weasel by the way.\n","output":"Oh, you don't even know. You know nothing about it. You're just like \"I got this.\" Swing upward, break the surface.

I rolled a seven.\n","output":"That's all right. So, first round of battle. Up first, you watch as these two emerging whirlpools begin to form into these amorphous angry spinning and intense-looking tiny water spouts with bashing pseudopods that swing out and attempt to make some sort of heavy impact with anybody who's nearby. They seem strangely sentient, as opposed to being some sort of manifested trap. However, with that first initial attack from Beau, that's the first surprise round, we'll be going into combat.

Five points of damage.\n","output":"Five points of damage. The Eldritch Blast hits it, and you watch as it creates this circle in the center of its elemental form as it impacts and actually strikes the stone behind with whatever residual energy from the original impact.

Now, wartime puts us in an unfortunate scenario. Zadash effectively governs the southern half of the empire and most of military might is now leaving us. Our Crownsguard will be stretched thin across keeping the peace and dealing with unrest and worry and protecting these walls from whatever pushes through the lines of battle and the general things that wander from beyond our boundaries. Money isn't an issue, but personnel is. There are outlying threats and criminals we no longer have the manpower for and as such, the Crown has approved an expanded mercenary budget. Now you've already proven your ability to me twice. Most recent, your skills in the Victory Pit showing you capable and loyal to the king. I know not your interest, but if you would come under contact, under my office as legionnaires of the empire, you would be responsible for protecting the lives of many innocent people. Now, under contract you would receive 15 gold a week per person as a stipend whether or not you were on contract or not. It could be at your leisure, months at a time with no work and you still get paid no matter what you do. Each assignment rewards its own bounty of course, case by case. The work I'll be presenting would largely involve the hunting of outstanding criminals, the acquisition of resources that may benefit the Empire in this time of war, and sometimes the extermination of dangerous creatures that threaten life away from the front lines.

They began seeking these artifacts known as the Vestiges of Divergence that promise ancient power from wars long past that could aid them in this journey. After acquiring one, with a near-death experience by Vex'ahlia over there, they began their next step in the journey. However, as part of a recent scrying spell by Keyleth, the druid, they discovered that the Pyrah tribe of her druidic heritage, the Ashari, were decimated as their home of Pyrah was the portal to the fire elemental plane that they normally guard, was where Thordak the Cinder King, the great red dragon, tore through into this prime realm and managed to seemingly wipe out most if not all of the tribe. Vox Machina made the relatively grim journey back to the mountainside, finding it now brimming with volcanic rock and volcanic activity that previously lay dormant. Upon climbing the side of the mountain, you found remnants of the Pyrah tribe still alive, and making their way up the mountain, as damaged as they are, in hopes of sealing this now progressively swelling tear between the prime material plane and the elemental plane of fire. Not just that, there was aid that came to the Pyrah tribe. And it involved a number of Air Ashari, one of which was Korren, Keyleth's father. There was a brief, tearful exchange and reunion before the rest of you, steeling yourselves, began to walk in towards the center of the mountain's caldera, towards the remnants of the Cindergrove, the now-destroyed and sundered petrified forest, in hopes of closing this rippling tear to the elemental plane once and for all. And this is where we begin. So. The group of the six of you, gathering alongside the dozen or so Pyrah members, with various burns, Cerkonos, who is the leader of the tribe, now missing his arm, cauterized at the shoulder, all advancing forward quietly in this tense push of necessity. You can see in the distance, swirling between the trees, clusters of glowing elemental entities that are either spilling forth from this recently and have taken this landscape as their own, or are just enjoying in their-- elementals like to burn shit. And so you're seeing fire elementals wandering about, just tearing through what remains of this countryside, and let's see, you actually, Vex'ahlia-- as you guys are stepping forward, keeping an eye on these glowing distant entities, these creatures, you catch out of the corner of your eye what appears to be a number of other humanoids, a small cluster of shadowed individuals far off to the left, tucked around the bottom of a tree.","instruction":"What should we anticipate as a result of these actions?"},{"input":"The group is preparing to close a rippling tear to the elemental plane of fire.

It's like looking into the sun, you have to avert your gaze; you cannot look directly at it without actually hurting your eyesight. And you can see, there are multiple paths of this molten lava, pouring out from this new volcanic activity. You can see it burbling up and bubbling underneath, like the very presence of this tear itself is causing the activity to just raise and grow more fervent.

They express regret for leaving him behind and wonder if they can bring him back. Keyleth mentions a new spell she recently learned that could potentially bring him back, but it requires 25,000 gold pieces worth of diamonds. The group expresses shock at the amount and Keyleth clarifies that it's not just gold, but diamonds. They realize they are in the Feywild and may be able to find the necessary materials there.\n\nIn some degrees. Whether through bad luck or not fully understanding the scope of what you were up against, a number of you fell in battle, with one of them not being able to be restored, being Vax'ildan, who was reduced to dust by a Disintegration spell. Realizing that your fortunes were failing, with Grog banished to another dimension and only barely returning in time, you joined hands and Keyleth attempted to travel you out of the plane to safety, of which Vecna attempted to stop with a Counterspell, and Scanlan attempted to stop that Counterspell with his own Counterspell, like a bard is wont to do. So you successfully transported, grabbing the corpse of Delilah Briarwood, who Percival finished off with a shot to the head. You found yourselves, last we left off, emerging deep into a wooded forest in some unknown location within the Feywild. Upon arriving, and glancing about, to see that you're still mostly intact, clutching the no-longer-living corpse of Delilah behind you. Vax, not with you, and Vex, realizing, asked the question:\nLAURA: Where's Vax?\nSAM: I walk up to her and I set down his armor and don't say anything.\nLAURA: What's this? Where is he?!\nSAM: There's nothing left. He was obliterated.\nMARISHA: Disintegrated.\nLAURA: What?!\nMARISHA: I saw it happen, and then I saw it happen.\nLAURA: And we just left him there?!\nMARISHA: No, we brought--\nTALIESIN: We brought everything we could.\nLAURA: Oh god!

I think. I'm so sorry.\nLAURA: What are you talking about?\nMARISHA: I cast Foresight on him. And I think there was a thing for a second. I haven't thought of those ramifications of something like that before. I think he was held and there was nothing he could do. What if that happened? What if he saw himself die?\nTALIESIN: Then it doesn't matter yet, until we bring him back.\nTRAVIS: Only matters what we do next, right?\nTALIESIN: Let's bring him back.\nTRAVIS: What's this new spell you were talking about?\nMARISHA: I need 25,000 gold pieces worth of diamonds.\nTRAVIS: What?\nMARISHA: I need 25--\nLAURA: Not just gold, you need diamonds?\nTALIESIN: Where are we?\nLAURA: I don't have-- I don't have that!\nMARISHA: We're in the Feywild.\nTALIESIN: We can find it, then.\n","output":"As you look around at this point, for the first time really taking in the surroundings around you, you find yourself deep in a shaded, thick wood, where most of the leaves here are wide and triangular in shape.

She asks if there are any stags or large animals they can use to distract the eye.\n\nYou're familiar with forests, definitely, and you can see telltale signs of scurrying, telltale signs of track marks in the ground, feces left behind by living creatures.

You will yourself to see something, anything, and in an instant, you begin to glow. Your form becomes visible around you. You can now see your body, nude and held aloft in this dark space, emanating this soft, vibrant orangish-white light.

You think you yell out, but as you glance upward to shout for help, you see the shadows now curl back to reveal the familiar sight of a massive white porcelain woman's face. Eyeless, yet staring straight at, if not through you.

Vox Machina, a group of adventurers currently on the path to try and usurp and destroy the Chroma Conclave, a collection of chromatic dragons that have torn through Tal'Dorei and currently reign supreme over the partially ruined cities that dot the landscape. The largest of them, and apparently the leader, Thordak the Cinder King sitting in the main city of Emon, forcing you guys to flee. You've gone about and discovered these artifacts, these legendary items known as the Vestiges of Divergence. Ancient magical weapons and equipment from the last great war, the Divergence. And these seem to be a key in which you can ascertain a level of power and a means of destroying these creatures. Upon seeking information about these, you traveled south to the Frostweald, where you battled a camp of orcs, freeing survivors from Westruun's attack, and managed to walk your way into the deep den of a forgotten Ioun temple where Osysa, the sphinx's mate, resides. After traversing past traps and puzzles you made your way to the main chamber in which the nameless sphinx demanded you reveal that you have earned its name. During this battle you traveled through portals to other elemental realms to seek out the information to hopefully devise the title of this sphinx before it was too late. During which, Grog leapt through, if I recall, one of these portals into the Elemental Plane of Air. Set adrift without a means of returning, he took his Chain of Returning, attached it to Craven Edge, and threw it through the portal. It found purchase and you pulled yourself through, face-to-face with Pike, with the blade embedded in her abdomen. The weapon, which had achieved its maximum strength potential of devouring the essence of others, transformed during this battle and has been in its rather intense and dangerous form since. You guys managed to piece together the name of this sphinx, at which point the battle ended and it presented to you the information you required. It gave you the information of the Vestiges that still exist, to its knowledge, and you were escorted via immediate sandstorm out of the temple and now stand at the edge of the Stormcrest Mountains and the Frostweald Forest itself. So.

You begin to crest over the edge of Thar Amphala, over the titan, and down towards the center of Vasselheim, the wind roaring past your face, your cloaks whipping behind you. You have a bird's-eye view of the city that you've essentially saved. And really, did so through a quick jaunt to the Feywild. The Braving Grounds still, while in severe disarray and flames still burn, most everything's under control now. Whatever remains of the remnant cultists, warriors, and undead have either been destroyed, captured, or run out of the city.

You hear the shouts behind you. As you begin to make your way around the Heaven's Stair mountain and then up, gliding over the steps leading up towards the platinum sanctuary. As you begin to glide up, you can see the steps are littered with broken bone, splatters of blood, broken bodies and silvered armor, and familiar black sludge, connoting the remains of slain gloomstalkers. The immediate ground conflict is over here and has been for some time. The stillness is now occupied with clusters of wounded riders and platinum warriors that now rest atop the apex of the stair and the sanctuary platform itself before you approach the entryway in the pillars. As you ascend, floating up, Devo'ssa lands right at the top of the stair as all the soldiers and medics who are in the process of handling the wounded, gathering the dead, all stop and look at the majestic brass dragon form as they lower themselves to allow each of you to carefully step off. As you do, you watch as the chatter, the conversation, the quiver of worry, the intensity of the recovery, comes to stillness as each of the soldiers, even those who have seen better days, stand up with a look of acknowledgment, greeting you as you arrive, and all give a respectful bow of the head or kneel to you as you approach and pass by. In the stillness, you begin to walk towards the opening of the sanctuary, the doors open already, and glance over your shoulder to see that J'mon has retaken their human form and is now walking at your side. Entering the sanctuary, you can see folks are rushing around a bit, and they notice your arrival, as well, but are also trying to make sure that everything is accounted for, and there's a bit of hustle and bustle. The old Scalebearer Yon, who greeted you first to Vasselheim, approaches quickly. \"Oh, goodness me! Hello? You're well. You've looked better, but so have we. That's fine. I have questions to ask. But perhaps it's best that-- come with me.\" And darts back towards the central meeting chambers of the Platinum Sanctuary. You can see the circle of pillars that surround the wide marbled floors of the center chamber where all these council meetings have previously taken place. You can see battle has taken place here. While most of the bodies or the wounded or dead have been removed at this point, you can see there are elements of chipped and broken stone and marble. You can see scattered remains and blood stains at points towards the entryway. But most of it appears to have been halted at the entryway. All of the combat has halted within the sanctuary. Glancing past, you can see most of the council you met last is not here. They're probably handling their various portions of the city. But you do see amongst a number of inner guardians of the sanctuary Highbearer Vord, who himself looks like he's seen a bit of a fray, and Allura Vysoren to his side. Both harried, but alive. As soon as you begin to approach, their conversation comes to a halt. As Allura turns and sees you all, her face brightens and she immediately rushes up, tossing any sort of formalities to the side, and runs up. Before she can give you a hug, she sees the child in your arms.","instruction":"Extend the story."},{"input":"The group arrives in Vasselheim and is greeted by J'mon Sa Ord, who offers to take them to the remaining council members.

Trinket, her bear companion, stays close to her.\n\nOver to here? All righty. Trinket, who hasn't seen you in a while, is sticking to your back.\nLAURA: I sit there and I kind of pet him as I look around the corner.\n","output":"Okay. Trinket is enjoying the petting. All right, so that duergar's down, the current armory section appears to be completely open and at your disposal. There are a series of partially made weapons kind of scattered in a pile. There are some ingots, and even some raw iron material in the far corner.

The group deals a significant amount of damage to the duergar.\n\nBoth hit, go ahead and roll damage on both.\nLIAM: 32 for me.\n","output":"Okay. So as you watch them both walk past you, one of them continues past with his hammer out, rushing towards whatever he sees moving at the end of the hallway, probably Tiberius after Trinket. The next one that comes past you, you reach around and just take your dagger and swing it across the back of his neck area.

Eight.\n","output":"Okay. So you still get the attack, but you don't have advantage, 'cause he's aware you're there.

So you slowly approach the door using your keen senses, which opens up this hallway a little bit visibly to you. You can see it goes back quite a bit. Sniffing this room, you can tell that there were duergar there recently. Apparently, at the moment, though, there is no immediate scent that matches a duergar. So the room, for the most part, has been completely evacuated.","instruction":"Please proceed with the story."},{"input":"The group splits up to explore different areas of the fortress. Vax and Scanlan listen at different doors and hear no noise. Orion's character, Tiberius, tries to move ahead of Grog to get a better look. Scanlan decides to open one of the doors to see what's inside.\n\nOkay.\nSAM: 'Cause why not?\n","output":"You open the door. It appears to be some sort of a guest bedroom. It's a singular bed that's in much better condition than the barracks, it's empty, it's well-made. It's more lit than the other rooms. It seems to be a room that's designed for either non-duergar riff-raff or general soldiers or guests or people that would come to the fortress to stay, so.","instruction":"Let the plot evolve."},{"input":"The group splits up to explore different areas of the fortress.

So as you glance inside the room, you see what appears to be a great hall of some kind. There are large wooden tables, there is a fire pit in the center that has a number of mostly burned wood that is mainly just small darkened embers with a little bit of glowing yellow and red to it. There are stools scattered about the room, you can see there are remnants of some of a meal that hasn't been fully cleaned up yet on some of the tables. But the room appears to be empty. You do see a slight glimmer across the way on one of the tables.","instruction":"Enhance the narrative."},{"input":"The group splits up to explore different areas of the fortress.

All right.\nORION: Yeah. (laughter)\nORION: It's on camera, tell them to play back.\n","output":"So you go ahead and cast Blur. You guys see as Tiberius comes running back, (startled sounds). He manages to cast a spell really fast as two javelins come flying towards him. His visible image begins to actually blur; the outline looks almost like there's two mirror images of Tiberius in the same place that are both shimmering and preventing them from actually telling where he's actually standing. The first javelin comes in at a 14.","instruction":"What's the next chapter in this story going to reveal?"},{"input":"The group splits up to explore different areas of the fortress.

Yes.\n","output":"Oh sorry, no, it's a four, 'cause it has disadvantage. So both javelins just whish past. Looks like they pierced part of that kinda shimmering blurring form, but both just ricochet off the walls of stone and come clattering to the ground. Kinda near back where Kima and Grog are. They both step out of the way as they land.","instruction":"Don't halt the story."},{"input":"The group is split up and Scanlan makes a mess in a guest bedroom while the others move around.

All right. So you hop on the back of Trinket, (laughs) looking over the top, and you know Grog is kinda blocking part of your view, but you can see, with your low-light vision, what looks to be Tiberius' form shimmering and two duergar-height individuals that are partially blocked by him. So they do have partial cover, or three-quarters cover. Do you have the feat that ignores that?","instruction":"What are the possible ripple effects of this event?"},{"input":"Tiberius casts Blur and successfully defends against two javelins thrown at him by duergar. Vex climbs on Trinket's back to get a better view and sees Tiberius and two duergar. She shoots two arrows at them but only one hits due to their cover and the darkness. She then applies Hunter's Mark to the duergar.\n\n(laughs) All right. There you go. 12, then add your Hunter's Mark bonus to that as well.\nLAURA: Oh, good, one.\n","output":"All right, gotcha. So one arrow sinks in the shoulder, but doesn't appear to be stopping his angry advance towards Tiberius. Let's see. You're staying where you are?","instruction":"So, what comes after this step in the process?"},{"input":"Vex climbs on Trinket's back to get a better view and sees Tiberius and two duergar. She shoots two arrows at them but only one hits due to their cover and the darkness. She then applies Hunter's Mark to the duergar. Meanwhile, Tiberius is caught by the two duergar who attack him with hammers. One of the attacks hits him. Liam decides to hold and wait.\n\nAnd a 17.\nORION: 17 hits.\n","output":"Okay, yeah, that Blur is saving you, man. All right, so as the one-- both the duergar are kinda like swelling with frustration, anger. It's an ability, you've now gotten to the point where you can see, these duergar can actually temporarily increase their form for stronger blows and attacks. Comes and strikes you for 12 points of bludgeoning damage as the hammer comes cracking down, finding purchase on your torso, and it kinda pushes you back a few inches. That's gonna bruise tomorrow morning.","instruction":"What can we expect to unfold given the present conditions?"},{"input":"Keyleth attempts to vault off of Grog's back to attack the duergar closest to Tiberius. She rolls an acrobatics check and gets an 11, which is not enough to give her the momentum she needs. She is still able to jump over Grog and attack the duergar with a bite attack, dealing 10 points of piercing damage. Liam mentions that he can get sneak attack damage since Tiberius is there.\n\n17? That hits. Go ahead and roll for damage.\nMARISHA: 1d10 plus five. Where's my d10s? Ten damage. Piercing damage.\n","output":"Ten piercing damage, all right. So, as you rush forward, you bite at him. You see he pulls back, but you get a big, meaty chunk of his forearm and clamp down, and you feel a snap, some sort of bone in the middle of his arm and he gives out a horrible-- (yells) sound, as he takes the butt of his hammer and hits you on the snout. Doesn't do any damage, but it's enough to get you to kind of let go of your grip a little bit, and he rips his arm out of your jaws. Leaving that kind of nasty, irony taste of duergar blood, that you've now become accustomed to, unfortunately. That ends the round. Now you have Tiberius and a cat in your way.","instruction":"How will things unfold from here on out?"},{"input":"Keyleth attacks the duergar with a bite attack, dealing 10 points of piercing damage. The duergar hits her on the snout with the butt of his hammer, causing her to let go. Liam throws a dagger at the duergar, hitting him for 9 points of damage. He then follows up with another dagger, dealing an additional 9 points of damage. The group realizes that they don't get the sneak attack bonus since they are not in melee combat with the duergar.\n\nAll right, go ahead and roll damage on the second dagger. Which is 1d4 plus what?\nLIAM: Six. That's a nine.\n","output":"Nine, okay. So, after the guy rips his arm out of Keyleth's face, essentially, a dagger comes swinging out from behind the doorway, stabs him in the other shoulder. You see he looks down at it confused for a second, and as that dagger vanishes in a puff of dark smoke, returning to your-- the side of your hilt, he looks up just in time to see the second dagger catch him right in the middle of the forehead, and he just falls onto his back at that point, unmoving. That duergar is stripped.","instruction":"What should we brace ourselves for, given these circumstances?"},{"input":"Pike moves to a secondary guest room and doesn't do anything. Kima is frustrated that she can't find a way over. Clarota holds on to his position while still invisible. Tiberius casts Firebolt on the duergar, dealing 23 points of damage. The group is in a hurry to move for the next turn.\n\n20, all right. That'll hit, go ahead and roll for damage for the Firebolt.\nORION: Okay, ten, 18, 20, 21, 23.\n","output":"23 damage? All right. So as you instinctively pull back, you release the blast of Firebolt energy, the duergar who is currently harrying you with this warhammer takes the brunt of it right to the bottom of his face and his torso. The studded leather armor that he's wearing tears open with a sheer flaming burst of the impact of it, and you see most of his skin is charred and burned at that point. He reels back for a second, looking very, very hurt but not quite put down yet.","instruction":"What's the next milestone we can expect in this journey?"},{"input":"The group decides to follow Scanlan as he heads towards the shiny object in the room. As they approach it, the doors slam shut, trapping Tiberius, Grog, and Keyleth outside. The room goes pitch-black, and the group realizes they don't have any light sources. Liam jokingly suggests rolling for Deus ex Machina.\n\nGrog's gonna go for the door, however, at this point in time, I'm going to ask for--\nLAURA: Can we stealth? I mean, I guess we're all kind of--\nSAM: Ask for?\nLIAM: Roll for Deus ex Machina.\nSAM: Oh, You're gonna ask the chat room something?\n","output":"No, no, no. I'm not.

Ten to five?","instruction":"What's the next chapter in this story going to reveal?"},{"input":"The group rolls for initiative, with Grog going first, followed by Tiberius and Percy.

Sam asks if he gets his spells back, but Matt reminds him that they haven't rested yet. Kima is at the top of the initiative order.\n\nNo, you guys have not rested. All right, so first, the top actually-- Kima is at the top of the initiative order.\nMARISHA: Kima, get it girl, get it, get it girl.\n","output":"Kima angrily leaps on top of the table and goes running down with an angry yell, and leaps down toward the one that's currently grabbing onto you with its grapple. As she's running a little bit of light bursts, as you can see this divine energy begin to burst and glow off the edge of the greatsword that she's holding. She leaps down, and with a giant arc through the air that lights up that portion of the room with a brief sweep, the blade comes down towards-- oh, that'll hit. Second attack also hits.","instruction":"What can we infer about the subsequent steps in this progression?"},{"input":"Kima is at the top of the initiative order and angrily attacks the creature that's currently grappling Liam's character.

The first one comes through, cracks the door in half, splitting it down the center. Rears back a second time, cleaves through the door entirely. What little bit is left on the hinges, he kicks out with his foot, leaving now this side completely open to the interior. He then moves in around Clarota.

There's also the Alabaster Sierras themselves, which surround that peninsula that extends into the northern part of the continent. They are very tall, fjord-like, craggy mountain ranges up against the sea along the edge. They're a little more treacherous, but a little more out of the way; a backdoor route.

They decide to take the latter and Vex casts Pass Without a Trace on everyone. They are warned of the possibility of encountering mountain giants along the way.\n\nPercy, you are aware that here have been problems in the past with various mountain-faring giants that lived north of Whitestone that occasionally would wander too far south. They mostly kept to themselves, but occasionally they had some crossover, there were some scuffles here and there. So you guys are deciding to take the Alabaster Sierras?\nLAURA: Yes. I want to cast Pass Without a Trace on everyone.\n","output":"You guys head out from Westruun; it takes about a day's worth of travel. You stop in the Turst Fields. It's a small farming community. You ask around for a bit, most of the folks there say that they haven't had much trade or communication with Whitestone like they used to. They do still provide crops and such, but they don't allow anyone past into the actual forest. They trade at the boundary created by the forest. Still pay gold, but it seems to be more enclosed scenario, but very few folks there seem to question it. Business as usual is still left within Turst Fields. Make your way northward to the bottom of the Alabaster Sierras, and as you begin heading up the outskirts of this mountain range, you do notice that the mountains are extremely high in altitude. There's a perpetual climb at nearly a 40-degree angle as you continue upward further and further and further. The drop-off at the edge of the cliff is 1,000 to 2,000 feet at times, straight down into the ocean or rocks below. There are paths worn up here; it has been used as travel before. Although you're uncertain as to how recently it may have been traversed. Occasionally, the wind picks up and you have to steel yourself, push yourself against the side. The path, thankfully, is maybe 15, 20, sometimes 30 feet in width. It's not too much where you're being forced against the edge, but it's enough to be aware of the danger of the circumstance. You guys are heading up, I'd say, about half a day's travel, it's about 2:00 in the afternoon. Also, you can tell there are slight outcroppings a few hundred feet down to the bottom, a few bits of stone that jut out from the side. You can see small nests or bushes that have taken root on those side areas. The rock itself of this mountain range is unusually, unnaturally white. The actual rock that forms this entire region is almost a glowing quartz-like texture. There are parts that are almost translucent, there are parts that are very milky white. Number one, you can now understand as to partially why the area is called Whitestone, the town nearby, and you've heard mention from Percy in the past of the large quarries here that mine the stone for various uses and export it throughout all of Tal'Dorei. That's where a large portion of the town was built around that trade at the beginning of its construction. Eventually, you come to a point where there is a falloff on the path, where the erosion or some sort of large impact of the side caused the path to fall into a scooped crevasse that is a smooth fall down the side. There is no way across other than a large sea salt air-rotted rope bridge that goes across about a hundred feet. You see it rocking (creaking) with the wind.","instruction":"Let the story unfold."},{"input":"In the DND game, the group decides to take the more treacherous Alabaster Sierras route to Whitestone. Vex casts Pass Without a Trace on everyone as they travel through the mountains. They stop at Turst Fields and learn that communication with Whitestone has been limited.

Percy inspects the bridge from an engineering perspective but only gets a 10 on his investigation check.\n\nGo ahead and make an investigation check.\nTALIESIN: Ten.\n","output":"Okay. Looking at it, I mean, the anchors are pretty solid in the stonework. There's no looseness to their element. The rope itself is taut and seems to have serviced long enough. There are no signs of extreme wear other than just time and weather.","instruction":"What trajectory do you envision following this incident?"},{"input":"In the DND game, the group decides to cross the rickety rope bridge to continue their journey. Vex ties a rope around Liam's waist before he crosses, and they secure the rope on the other side using a sailor knot and a special ranger knot.

Liam makes a joke about being warned before Sam uses Dimension Door.\n\nWho's up next?\nLIAM: I double-knot mine.\nSAM: We've got to get the horses across.\nTRAVIS: No, they ain't coming.\nSAM: They're not coming? Oh. Well, I just Dimension Door across, then.\nLIAM: Jeepers! Will you warn a half-elf when you're going to do that?\n","output":"Spooks you for a second. You hold on and you make your way across.

I hop on Trinket and I pet Lockheed. And then I hop on Trinket and I cast Fly on him and say, Remember how to go across. And then as we start flying across, I cast Telekinesis on Grog and take him with me. Kind of like Green Lantern.\nMARISHA: Concentration spells.\nORION: Yeah. That should be 12 seconds to get across a bridge, right?\n","output":"Yeah, that would be 12 seconds, which will be enough time. So as you're coasting over with Trinket, floating (bear sounds) you turn around and cast Telekinesis. Grog, all of a sudden, you're lifted up and held aloft. You look down over yourself, waving your hands instinctually. Looking down, you can see a 600, 700 foot drop before the rock comes to a point which would probably splinter or crush anyone who fell into it, and then is pushed out to the ocean. So it's a little scary, but you start flailing about as you're being pulled across by Tiberius. Eventually, Trinket comes, lands on the other side safely. You guide Grog over, down onto his feet. Safe and sound.","instruction":"What potential ramifications could stem from this event?"},{"input":"In the DND game, the group successfully crosses the bridge using various spells and techniques. Tiberius uses Telekinesis to carry Grog across while keeping the spell active for ten minutes. The group discusses what to do with the horses and continues on their journey. As they walk, a gust of sea air blows in, and they must make an athletics check to hold on. Scanlan and Vax struggle and are pushed out, and Tiberius asks how much time has passed.\n\nAll right, as you guys are holding tight, both Scanlan and Vax are trying to grab something, holding onto rocks, but before they can get enough, they're both so small, it pushes them out.\nORION: How much time has passed?\n","output":"It's three seconds. Oh! Passed since the bridge? About five, six minutes.","instruction":"What trajectory do you envision following this incident?"},{"input":"In the DND game, Vax and Scanlan are dragged off the side of a cliff by a strong gust of wind.

Tiberius guides Vax back to safety, and the wind eventually dies down.\n\n19? Not a problem! The vine grabs Scanlan and pulls him back and holds him as the wind slowly dies down.\nORION: I guide Vax back to the cliff.\n","output":"The wind dies down. You guys now begin pushing yourselves close to the edge of this pathway up the side of this seaside cliff. It doesn't seem to deviate much beyond that 15-foot width now, which puts you all at general unease. As the sun's getting closer and closer to setting, you're making your way around the crest.

You take the next 15 minutes or so, finding what nearby pieces of brush you can and rocks that have been loosely around the area and you start setting up this pattern of them that closes off some of the entrance from the smooth opening that Keyleth had created.

There is a slight rockslide trail that you could climb up and over and it looks like there is a separate ravine, or a separation where the two mountains join, that could possibly be traversed.

They have completely gone into this combat between the two of them.","instruction":"What's the next chapter in this story going to reveal?"},{"input":"In the DND game, the group plans to flank the four lizard people but hears a sudden impact and sees three arrows hitting two of the lizardfolk. Two people in purple-ish robes rush forward and start attacking the lizardfolk, while a burly man with snake-like arms bites into the throat of one of the lizardfolk. The lizardfolk pull up their shields and engage in combat with the snake people. The group stays put and watches from the shadows. Liam doesn't see anything glowing on Jamedi, but they are too far away to see if the snake people have any magical items. Travis is surprised by the size of the burly man's arms. Sam comments that it's like an ultimate Godzilla movie.\n\nYeah.\nSAM: This is the ultimate Godzilla movie.\nTRAVIS: His big arms are five feet? Like, these big-ass--\n","output":"Yeah. About a foot wide and they spiral upward and then they snap into giant fangs that protrude and snap on each. His face is intense and grinning. This is a hunting party. One of the lizardmen grabs his spear and jams it into the abdomen of the man with the snake arms. Looks back and hisses at him angrily. Manages to pull the spear free with one of the snake hands, leaps over, pole vaulting off the ground, the other snakehead coming out and snapping into the shoulder and chest area of the snakeman and then throwing him up into the air. You hear (screech) as he goes flying, spinning up into the boughs, lands on the ground. He stands back up, grabs his shield, and you can see him woozy. There's this black color where the impact of the wound was, and you see the veins growing dark. It stumbles and falls onto its knees and then falls to the ground.","instruction":"Take the story further."},{"input":"In the DND game, the group watches as the snakeman hunting party engages in combat with the lizardmen. One of the lizardmen manages to injure the man with the snake arms, but he retaliates and throws the lizardman into the air, killing him. The group observes as each of the lizardmen are felled from the ambush, including two smaller creatures from the other party. The snakeman hunting party sustains some injuries but is ultimately successful. Travis asks if the other two in the party had eyes that seemed off.\n\nYes. Two of which looked to be comparably smaller creatures, but they just weren't prepared and while the three snakeman hunting party appeared to have sustained a few blows and injuries, they were successful.\nTRAVIS: The other two only had eyes that seemed off?\n","output":"Correct. As you're inspecting, you can see patches of skin across their shoulders and a part of the chest, you can see scales that appear and then vanish. With the battle done, the quiet hits, and they begin to walk off to a small patch where they had dropped some sort of a satchel. They start pulling out rope and they start tying the legs together of these lizardmen until they have two of them tied on one side and the other two tied ankle-to-ankle on the other. The one with the two snake arms picks up both and begins dragging them behind him in the jungle while the other two flank and look out into the grass below. They begin making their way deeper towards the path where they came, away from you. Their hunt successful, they're bringing their meal back with them.","instruction":"Proceed with the plot."},{"input":"In the DND game, the group discusses the best way to approach the upcoming encounter with the snake people.

You haven't quite reached this aforementioned ruin before night falls. Now the evening insects begin to grow louder and louder. The nocturnal creatures begin to let out the nocturnal calls. The perpetual din of the various clicks and cricket noises and other various flapping insects' mating calls into the night become this constant droning sound around you.

Taliesin and Jamedi keep watch, with Taliesin occasionally using a low-level Light cantrip to check for any threats.\n\n21? Okay.\nTALIESIN: I'll pop in the occasional low-level Light cantrip as far away from us as possible, just popping every now and then, if I think I see something.\n","output":"Okay. Following this little chain of lights that pop and glow as it goes, eventually you come upon the first signs of stone rubble. Some sort of structure was built here long ago, and has since fallen over, and elements of its masonry either moved or reclaimed for other structures elsewhere on the island, but you can see the basis of walls and joining positions where elements of this previous building were used to maintain and hold the ceiling that has since fallen in. There is a series of walked paths that carved through the various ferns and heavy bush, but you do find the back of one of these walls where Jamedi says, \"This is where I slept previously.

So to get you guys up to speed with the circumstance that has happened, those especially that are tuning in for the first time. A couple known as the Briarwoods that took over the city of Whitestone five years before, murdering most of the ruling family of Percy-- other than himself, escaping-- have recently been doing political discussions with the home city of Emon. Vox Machina, our troop of intrepid adventurers, upon discovering this, battled them at Emon. They fled to Whitestone, and the party has then gone after to seek to destroy them and free the town, the once-home to Percival. In the process, it appears that there have been a number of warnings set, and the entire town has been long held under this dark, ominous rule that they have kept at bay. Apparently, they have found notes of previous, failed rebellions, and things that die here don't seem to stay dead. A number of zombified giants are wandering the city as these giant lurching sentinels. And apparently, a number of the cutthroats that helped the Briarwoods come to power in this town have now been given titles and land here and are now called the new nobles by the locals. During this process, you guys managed to sneak into the town, began setting out word of coming rebellion and that Percival de Rolo has returned and the Briarwoods' time is numbered. Upon meeting the previous chancellor to your father of the town, Archibald, you guys came to an understanding, and he was going to reach out to all of his contacts and let them know that the rebellion is happening.

Grog's hammer managed to deal a significant amount of damage to the kraken's eye, causing it to retreat. The group is uncertain about the kraken's intentions and whether or not it was an idle threat. Durent arrives and asks about the whereabouts of Keyleth and the others, but the group is unsure. They also request to breathe some air after being underwater for so long.\n\n\"Well, let's hope that they know where they're going, at the very least. Any idea where they went?\"\nTALIESIN: Can we breathe some air? Please?\n","output":"\"Aye, aye, all right, follow me, follow me.\" And he starts leading the swimming cavalcade of individuals that are leading you up to the top of Vesrah. Back up through the Aerie of Torrent, through the various tubes and tunnels of the reef that leads towards the surface of the Ozmit Sea. Simultaneously, Keyleth, Vex, and the lifeless body of Vax, you apparate roughly ten feet above the surface of the water on the outskirts of Vesrah. Tumble a bit, and splash into the foot-and-a-half shallow waters on the outskirts. As you all get up for a minute and think about your circumstance.

Keyleth throws up a Sky Write above the city, asking for help, and then turns into a giant raven to fly towards the center of the city where she hopes to find sages and clerics. Vex is holding onto Keyleth as they fly. The group is focused on getting Vax the help he needs.\n\nOkay, so you're holding onto her.\nMARISHA: She's holding onto him and we're riding there.\n","output":"Okay, I see. I got you. Okay so you climb onto the back of the giant raven, clutching your brother in one arm, and as the wings pick up, you use all the might that you have to just hold on. You're used to flying under your own power usually, not somebody else's. But as the wings take off, the sea breeze, thankfully, is not too heavy that day. And as you coast in, coming down, dodging between the various buildings heading towards the central risen chamber. You watch as the upper, third-tier level of this, there's a single chamber that is open and the outside wall is a series of pillars that makes up the structure. On the inside, you can see it dips down into three different sunken platforms, and in the center there are a handful of small statues, there's incense being burned, and what looks to be a small altar of some kind. There are four figures there inside, all dressed in similar blues and greens, aquas and whites, most of them are just long robes with dangling shell-based jewelry, and various smoothed-off stones that have been found tossed and rounded by the elements through the years. And in the center of the chamber, in the process of lighting a few of these, you're not quite sure of the material, but they appear to be candles, as you see they're being lit like candles. You see Uvenda is walking with her staff, taking this long burning tube, and is currently setting them alight as you approach. As the wings of the raven begin to prepare for landing, the wind kicks up in front and you see some of the other guardians put their arm up and look up curiously. Some of them reaching back and preparing for whatever may be there. Uvenda's voice however rings out across the center of this chamber and says, \"Stop! Stop. I know this one who approaches.\" And as they all slowly back up, Uvenda stumbles upward, sets aside her small hand-based wick to one of the servants and approaches the raven as you begin to slink off the side of the bird.","instruction":"Let the plot evolve."},{"input":"In this conversation, Keyleth turns into a giant raven and flies towards the center of the city, where she hopes to find sages and clerics.

Uvenda suggests that they have the power to bring him back, though his form may be different. Keyleth asks if they have a means of traveling quickly to get to a friend who is a cleric, and Uvenda says they can reach out to someone for help.\n\n\"I have not a means of travel, but we could reach out to someone.\"\nMARISHA: Yeah, yeah. Any--\n","output":"\"All right.\" And she walks back to the altar, and you can see where there are a series of these statues. There's four of them in the center and there's one large statue in the center. And the center statue, it looks almost like long-petrified reef. It's white, it's porous, it looks like the long-dead reef. But it seems to swirl into a tree-like shape. It's this weird merging of sea and forest-based imagery, and as each various portion of the tree outstretches, you see various baubles are hanging from it. You see stones, necklaces, notes. Uvenda sets her staff to the side and her small, slightly arched form begins to slowly crawl up the side of the tree, and it looks a bit physically arduous for her but nobody offers to help. You see that this is something that she's done often and is part of her job as the guardian here in Vesrah.","instruction":"Go ahead with the story."},{"input":"In this conversation, Keyleth and Vex ride on the back of Keyleth's giant raven form towards the central chamber of the city where they hope to find sages and clerics.

The rest of the group is waiting in line for colorful drinks, and Grog hits on ladies but fails to impress them until he pretends to be the Countess of Febreze and makes a successful deception check. He then successfully hits on a woman who is impressed by his wealth and invites her to celebrate his victory with him.\n\nNow, the third woman you've come across in here turns around. She's maybe early forties, graying sides to her hair, pulled up tight, but impeccable makeup, beautiful jeweled earrings. She turns and gives you a glance. \"Oh, well, my apologies for not recognizing greatness in my presence. So why do you bother me?\"\nTRAVIS: Well, I am looking for a companion for the evening. I've had a great victory and I was hoping I might celebrate it with a fine lass like yourself.\n","output":"\"I do not mean to blush in the presence of such greatness, ha. I need to speak to my compatriot first. Honey?\" And this gentleman turns around, in fairly nice attire, dark blacks, jeweled necklaces, dark skin, square jaw, rather well-built, a human. Turns and goes, \"Yes, my dear?\" \"This fine fellow here is asking to spend the night with me, if that's all right with you.\" And he goes, (chuckles) \"What, this one?\"","instruction":"How might this incident pave the way for future events?"},{"input":"In this conversation, the group examines a strange plant-based substance they found. They discuss its taste and potential uses, with Grog eventually taking a big chunk and swallowing it. There are no immediate effects, but his stomach gets upset for a moment. Keyleth decides to light some of it with her flame hands to see what happens.\n\n(gulping sound) No effect. A few minutes go by, your stomach gets a little upset, but then it passes. Yeah, a little bit, but then it passes.\nMARISHA: I take a little bit in my hands and I light it with my flame hands to see what happens.\nTALIESIN: Oh no.\n","output":"Okay. The flame takes it, leaving behind this burning ember. The smoke emanates off of it. It gives this little plume of grayish brown.","instruction":"Carry on spinning the tale."},{"input":"In this conversation, the group realizes that the expensive spice they bought is just a flavoring spice and not worth the 50 gold they spent on it. They joke about the situation and try mixing it with wine, which makes Taliesin feel queasy. They also mention the Washington Redskins and Grog's wine. Eventually, Sam drinks some wine mixed with the spice and makes a successful constitution saving throw.\n\nMake a constitution saving throw.\nSAM: 17.\n","output":"17, okay. Beneath your nose, you can't feel anything. And right now, yeah, from here down. You guys watch as his tongue is hanging out, and you watch as drool is now pouring down the side of his chin.","instruction":"Can you foresee any upcoming challenges or changes?"},{"input":"In this conversation, the group decides to get some sleep and rest for the night. They discuss the magical items they have and the fact that they're waiting to hear back from Mistress Asharru. Scanlan wakes up with a headache and regrets spending so much gold on the spice. He considers selling it on the street to recoup some of the money. The group jokes about the situation, and Sam vows to find drugs next time.\n\nYou all have a full night's rest, back to full hit points. You get half your maximum hit dice back if you've spent any more than half of them. Scanlan, you wake up, quite a pounding headache in your head, but the rest of your body has its feeling back as you come to consciousness.\nSAM: Maybe I can package it into smaller amounts and sell it on the street to recoup some of the money. Do we have an afternoon to kill?\nTRAVIS: Are you talking to yourself?\nSAM: Yes. Damn it, what did I do? I should have insight checked him, or I could've dominated, there are so many things I could have done to him to find out! I flew too close to the sun. (laughter)\nSAM: (sighs) Next time. Next time I'll do things differently. Next time I will find drugs. That's the lesson to be taken from this, look harder. Look harder. The Meat Man never gives up.\nTALIESIN: I believe in you, Walter White. I believe in you.\n","output":"And another persona of Scanlan was born. All righty, so what are your plans for the day? As you stumble down into the main tavern area, you can see Treev's barely conscious himself and a few other patrons are waiting eagerly for their food as a few of the various barkeep assistants are bringing out breakfasts and meals. \"You'll want food on your way out, then?\"","instruction":"Advance the plot further."},{"input":"In this conversation, the group wakes up after a full night's rest and discusses their plans for the day. Scanlan wakes up with a headache and considers selling the expensive spice to recoup some of the money. The group jokes about Scanlan's persona and asks for breakfast and hangover remedies. They plan to visit the Crystal Chateau but learn that the people there are snobs and not easy to get information from. They also ask about Mistress Asharru but haven't heard back yet.\n\n\"Snobs of the highest order! At least from what I've seen. Allegiance of All-Sight and all that.\"\nTALIESIN: I love snobs. I'm excited.\nLAURA: Any word back from Mistress Asharru?\n","output":"\"Nope. No word. Who knows how long it'll take. She might not even like it. You may never hear back from her. In which case, if you wait long enough, I can see if I can hire someone else for you.\"","instruction":"Augment the narrative."},{"input":"In this conversation, the group has breakfast and Marisha makes a hangover tonic for Scanlan. They ask the innkeeper about the price of fusaka spice and learn that it's not as expensive as they thought. They also see what the spice looks like and decide to head to the Crystal Chateau. Before they leave, they ask Treev for directions to the Crystal Chateau.\n\nWho's leading the charge to the Crystal Chateau?\nMARISHA: We ask Treev first  where is the Crystal Chateau?\n","output":"He thinks for a second, \"Ain't been around those areas for a bit. Those'll be over in the Sigil District, and that's right down in the southeastern side of Ank'harel. Look for the raised landmass where it's carved off at the top. That's where most of all the bastards live and most of the training's done by the Allegiance folk.\"","instruction":"What sequence of events could this catalyst trigger?"},{"input":"In this conversation, the group learns more about how fusaka spice is used in cooking and decides to head to the Crystal Chateau. They ask Treev for directions and he tells them to look for the raised landmass in the southeastern side of Ank'harel. Taliesin leads the way but rolls a low investigation check and doesn't find anything.\n\nSix. What'd you roll?\nTALIESIN: Two.\n","output":"At least it's not a one. It takes you about four hours of wandering the city to finally get the proper directions to lead you towards the Sigil District to the Crystal Chateau. As you ascend through these streets, the red cobblestone that you've seen through most of the streets of Ank'harel gives way to this slightly opalescent surface where the light itself almost dances across the surface of the stones. It shifts in the outskirts of where the large hillside comes to an end, and the buildings here give way to an open space where you see a large, open square, but in the center of the square, there are ropes around some sort of large hole in the ground, probably a good 150 feet across. It is a circular chasm off to the eastern side of this large open square. There are maybe a half dozen individuals standing around the lip of it. A few of them are armed and armored, and a few of them seem to be dressed in long, relatively nice robes and light clothing. You see a number of longhouses with high steepled roofs with a yellowish-tan tint to them. These buildings are very nice. They look constructed in a type of architecture that's more reminiscent of Tal'Dorei or other civilizations than you've seen most of Ank'Harel's construction, so you figure these buildings are probably newer or at least this district seems to have a little different cultural flavor to it than the rest of the city. To the southern side of it you do see a large multi-tiered structure that is made of a smoky quartz mixed with white marble in places. This, with an immediate glance, you'd probably gather is the Crystal Chateau.","instruction":"What will be the repercussions of this choice?"},{"input":"In this conversation, the group finally heads towards the Crystal Chateau after getting directions from Treev. Taliesin rolls a low investigation check and it takes them four hours to find the district. They arrive at an opalescent square with a large circular chasm in the center, surrounded by armed guards and individuals in robes. They also see newer buildings made of smoky quartz and white marble, which Taliesin notes has traces of ground-in whitestone particles. Laura walks up to the guards and asks about the hole in the ground, but they immediately become suspicious and put their hands on their weapons.\n\nAs soon as you walk up, two of the guards give you a keen look and put their hands on the sides of their sheathed weapons.\nLAURA: No worries. I'm from out of town. I just was very curious.\n","output":"They look at each other and some of the more-- for lack of a better term, more academic looking individuals-- shy away from this seemingly growing possible confrontation, from their perspective. They begin to pull back and walk down this slightly descending, spiral-like path, that's about ten feet off the inside of this carving into the floor. They begin to descend down into it. One of the guards says, \"This is where the Allegiance is currently excavating.\"","instruction":"How might this incident pave the way for future events?"},{"input":"In this conversation, the group discusses the large circular chasm in the middle of the opalescent square and wonders if it's similar to the ziggurat in Whitestone. They note that the stones around the chasm look like they were excavated and not built around. Taliesin speculates that the whitestone used to construct the buildings in the district may have come from Whitestone itself. Grog gets a gold star from Marisha and eats it, while Taliesin suggests finding a big door to attack.\n\nYou hear a crunching between his pearly white, larger-than-average goliath teeth.\nTALIESIN: This is good news, if it is whitestone. It means that we at least have some leverage here. Let's find a big door, the biggest door we can find, and attack it!\n","output":"That's always worked out well for you guys in the past. You make your way south of the square to the Crystal Chateau. There is a large white iron gate that surrounds the premises. And from where the cobblestone ends beyond that gate it is a fairly beautiful, well-kept, fenced-off garden, where you see some trees popping up, green grass. Looks to be a small stream that runs through, there's a bridge off the main path that leads to the chateau that goes over it. The water seems to butt up against the chateau and vanish beneath it, to continue within the actual structure. As you head to the front gate you see the door there, and there are two small handles on the outside. You go to pull and it doesn't open.","instruction":"What are the likely consequences of this action?"},{"input":"In this conversation, the group discusses the possibility of the chasm being related to Whitestone and Taliesin suggests finding a big door to attack. They arrive at the Crystal Chateau and find a well-kept garden with a small stream running through it. Taliesin knocks on the gate and the doors to the chateau peek open slightly, but the figure inside disappears. Taliesin shouts that they are there on official business and from Tal'Dorei, while Scanlan holds up a necklace. They wonder if they can just walk up to the door.\n\nThe door still remains ajar, but the figure has pulled back in. Are you shouting this at a distance?\nTALIESIN: Yes, I am. It will be very worth your while, and someone will definitely wish to speak with us. We've traveled from Tal'Dorei.\nSAM: Can we just walk up to the door?\n","output":"The head peeks out again and you get a better look at it this time. It's short, oval to the side almost? The head has this very wide, short, stocky, very pointed nose and a very pointed chin. No facial hair, however. Bald on top and what you see as a bit of grey hair that's frizzed on the sides. As it steps outside, you see its stature is similar to Scanlan's. This appears to be a gnomish individual. Pale skin, paler than most of you and definitely most people you've seen here in Ank'Harel and as it steps out, it has white robes with gray streaks across the front and back that fall into this cape in the back and with its arms placed within its robes. Its small footfalls comes across the path, over the bridge, up to the front of the gate and is now facing you guys on the other side of the gate. Up close, it is a very old gnome. Those of you who have known gnome longevity, that's many years. Strangely adorable, the eyes are tiny and beady, the eyebrows are furrowed. There's a slight smile and this elderly sweetness to him as he approaches with his arms in his robe.","instruction":"How might this situation advance in the near future?"},{"input":"In this conversation, the group arrives at the Crystal Chateau and tries to open the gate, but it doesn't budge. Taliesin knocks and a gnomish figure appears, introducing himself as Grymond Trog. Liam asks for help with some items they have and Laura asks to meet with Headmaster James Kryon, mentioning J'mon Sa Ord sent them. Scanlan flashes the necklace and speaks in Gnomish, saying that Kryon will want to talk to them.\n\n\"You don't have to do that here.\"\nLAURA: Could we meet with Headmaster James Kryon? We've been sent by someone very important. J'mon Sa Ord.\nTALIESIN: From across the continent.\nSAM: I flash the thing again and say, in Gnomish He'll want to talk to us. We've come a great distance to meet him.\n","output":"And he responds in Gnomish to you, \"Very well. I will go and see if the Headmaster is available.

They wait for 15 minutes before Grymond pops his head out again. Travis suggests putting Scanlan's sacks of spice in the bag of holding, but Scanlan refuses. The group expresses their fondness for Grymond.\n\nYou wait about 15 minutes before the gnome, Grymond, pops his head out once more. \"Just a minute.\" Pops back in.\nLIAM: I like that little guy.\nTALIESIN: I know; he's quite pleasing.\n","output":"Pops back out about ten minutes later.

This taller humanoid, as it approaches, you see the same white robes with the same silver grey band that goes over the shoulders, the mantle pointing out past the shoulders, as it passes back into a cloak that drifts behind. The train of the robe's dragging just a few inches past the back. They seem longer than should be for a normal traveling person; they're almost ceremonial. As the humanoid approaches, you can see silver, almost purple-colored hair, that just falls back and trails past, without a stray hair in place, long past the shoulders, almost like a secondary cloak and flows with each step, just like the cloak does. The face is pure elven, skin pale white, the eyes white with a very faint gold iris. No pupil. Seems young, though the graying hair does lead you to believe that there is some age to this elven individual. Approaches, hands together in front. Eventually comes to the edge of the gate. \"My apologies for the delay.

Taliesin requests to speak in private, and the figure encases them in a cube-like box with a crackling blue wall. Laura asks if the fence is still between them.\n\n\"Very well.\" He snaps his fingers and utters this incantation under his mouth.

Instead of doing that, she stayed back to do that and is now looking up towards the demon that is raging onto the base of the ship.

It talks about different forms of fiends and demons and the hierarchy of the Nine Hells. It talks about myths and stories of devils and demons interfering with the lives of mortals. A lot of it is fables, a lot of it is warnings and things that parents would tell to keep their children from wandering in the darkness. But it does have little tidbits of information about different types, and they talk about horned devils, and they talk about the great and terrible balor and pit fiend, and it seems to be a jumble between both demons and devils.","instruction":"Elaborate on the story."},{"input":"During the game, the group discusses the creature they are pursuing and its feeding habits. Liam reads from a book about the creature, which siphons the life off of mortal creatures without harming them. The group recalls seeing both the slow and fast feeding methods and wonders if the creature is related to the periwinkles they had discussed before. They ask about weaknesses and vulnerabilities, and Laura suggests that most fiends are weak to holy damage. They make religion checks, but Taliesin and Laura don't learn much about the creature's weaknesses. Sam jokingly suggests poppyseed muffins as a vulnerability.\n\nSure, I'll let you roll for it.\nSAM: They have a vulnerability to poppyseed muffins.\nTALIESIN: Nine.\nLAURA: 14.\n","output":"You don't get the idea that most devils or demons have a vulnerability to radiant or holy damage. Some might, some don't, but you're unable to take a bead on this. The book you have is informative from an encyclopedia standpoint.

We'll pick this up tomorrow.\"","instruction":"Please proceed with the story."},{"input":"During the game, the group discusses Liam's plan and he asks for an iron pot and incense. They realize they need to go buy some incense and suggest the remedy store up the street. Sam offers to sneak in and grab it, but Liam prefers to buy it with gold to avoid trouble with the law. Travis and Taliesin offer to contribute a gold each, and Laura offers to contribute one as well, leaving them with a total of eight gold.\n\nAll right, so you have ten gold between you nine from Fjord, and one from Molly.\nLAURA: Okay, I'll put one in, then you have only eight.\n","output":"Okay, so eight off. All right, you have the gold. We'll say for the purposes of expediency, it's easy enough to go and purchase the necessary incense and it's quite a bit.
